          The Cartesi Guardians are a unique collection of 256 NFTs that
          represent a fusion between mythology, technology and exclusive
          opportunities for CTSI token stakers. These guardians, inspired by
          mythological creatures and deities such as{" "}
          <span className="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 ">
            Hanuman, Heimdallr, Kitsune, Phoenix, Morgana, Caladrius, Bastet,
            Brienne, Quetzalcoatl, Kukulkan, Poseidon and Neptune
          </span>
          , have been selected to embody the diversity and nobility within us.
          They function as token-gated badges, allowing users who participate in
          staking, to access exclusive benefits. Those who own a Cartesi
          Guardian will get special discounts, early access to VIP staking pools
          (USTD, USDC, ETH), lower unstaking fees. The amount of CTSI staked
          determines earning these guardians, providing an additional incentive
          to participate in staking and strengthen the community. <br />
