            Heimdallr is a legendary figure known for his role protecting the kingdom of the gods.
			He has supernatural sight and hearing that allow
            him to observe and hear everything that happens in the nine worlds.
            He can see to the end of time and hear the grass growing. He stands
            on the Bifr√∂st, the bridge that connects Asgard to Midgard. His
            constant vigilance protects Asgard from intrusions and threats. He
            is also known for his wielding of the Gjallarhorn, the magical horn
            of which will sound with a deafening roar to announce Ragnarok.
			<br />
            Heimdallr represents light and vigilance. Despite knowing all the
            secrets of the universe, He is noble and honorable, always
            acts with integrity. The figure of Heimdallr continues to inspire
            people today as a symbol of vigilance, protection and fight for
            worthy causes.
